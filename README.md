# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains solutions to the [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

## What was in the scope

- Finding a solution to both parts of each daily puzzle.

- Sticking solely to Python with no external dependencies.

- Not reuising any code between any of the daily puzzles.

- Sticking to synchronous execution on a single thread.

- Writing correct code that is relatively nice and elegant.

- Solving each problem in a reasonable amount of time.

- Answering each part of the puzzle in a separate run.

## What was out of scope

- Providing the most performant or optimized solution.

- Making the code more readable or maintainable.

- Avoiding code duplication or sticking to a convention.

- Reducing the number of lines or characters in the code.

(If any of the above is fulfilled, it is simply by chance or by habit.)
